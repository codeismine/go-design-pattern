### The Catalog of Go Examples

- **Creational Patterns**: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

  - **Abstract Factory**

  ![Abstract Factory](./img/abstract-factory-mini.png)

  Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

  üí¨ **Intent**

  **Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

  ![Abstract Factory](./img/abstract-factory/abstract-factory-en.png)

  üôÅ **Problem**

  Imagine that you‚Äôre creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:

  1. A family of related products, say: `Chair` + `Sofa` + `CoffeeTable`.

  2. Several variants of this family. For example, products `Chair` + `Sofa` + `CoffeeTable` are available in these variants: `Modern`, `Victorian`, `ArtDeco`.

  ![Abstract Factory Problem](./img/abstract-factory/problem-en.png)

  > Product families and their variants.

  You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture.

  ![Abstract Factory Comic 1](./img/abstract-factory/abstract-factory-comic-1-en.png)

  > A Modern-style sofa doesn‚Äôt match Victorian-style chairs.

  Also, you don‚Äôt want to change existing code when adding new products or families of products to the program. Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn‚Äôt want to change the core code each time it happens.

  üòé **Solution**

  The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can implement the `Chair` interface; all coffee table variants can implement the `CoffeeTable` interface, and so on.

  ![Abstract Factory Solution 1](./img/abstract-factory/solution1.png)

  > All variants of the same object must be moved to a single class hierarchy.

  The next move is to declare the Abstract Factory‚Äîan interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family (for example, `createChair`, `createSofa` and `createCoffeeTable`). These methods must return abstract product types represented by the interfaces we extracted previously: `Chair`, `Sofa`, `CoffeeTable` and so on.

  ![Abstract Factory Solution 2](./img/abstract-factory/solution2.png)

  > Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific product variant.

  Now, how about the product variants? For each variant of a product family, we create a separate factory class based on the `AbstractFactory` interface. A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the `ModernFurnitureFactory` can only create `ModernChair`, `ModernSofa` and `ModernCoffeeTable` objects.

  The client code has to work with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces. This lets you change the type of a factory that you pass to the client code, as well as the product variant that the client code receives, without breaking the actual client code.

  ![Abstract Factory Comic 2](./img/abstract-factory/abstract-factory-comic-2-en.png)

  > The client shouldn‚Äôt care about the concrete class of the factory it works with.

  Say the client wants a factory to produce a chair. The client doesn‚Äôt have to be aware of the factory‚Äôs class, nor does it matter what kind of chair it gets. Whether it‚Äôs a Modern model or a Victorian-style chair, the client must treat all chairs in the same manner, using the abstract `Chair` interface. With this approach, the only thing that the client knows about the chair is that it implements the `sitOn` method in some way. Also, whichever variant of the chair is returned, it‚Äôll always match the type of sofa or coffee table produced by the same factory object.

  There‚Äôs one more thing left to clarify: if the client is only exposed to the abstract interfaces, what creates the actual factory objects? Usually, the application creates a concrete factory object at the initialization stage. Just before that, the app must select the factory type depending on the configuration or the environment settings.

  üíÖ **Conceptual Example**

  Say, you need to buy a sports kit, a set of two different products: a pair of shoes and a shirt. You would want to buy a full sports kit of the same brand to match all the items.

  If we try to turn this into code, the abstract factory will help us create sets of products so that they would always match each other.

  ‚úç **iSportsFactory.go: Abstract factory interface**

  ```go
  package abstractfactory

  import "fmt"

  type ISportsFactory interface {
    makeShoe() IShoe
    makeShirt() IShirt
  }

  func GetSportsFactory(brand string) (ISportsFactory, error) {
    if brand == "adidas" {
      return &Adidas{}, nil
    }

    if brand == "nike" {
      return &Nike{}, nil
    }

    return nil, fmt.Errorf("Wrong brand type passed")
  }
  ```

        size: 14,
      },
    }
  }

  func (a *Adidas) makeShirt() IShirt {
    return &AdidasShirt{
      Shirt: Shirt{
        logo: "adidas",
        size: 14,
      },
    }

  [Code example](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight/go/example#example-0)

  - **Proxy**

  ![Proxy](./img/proxy-mini.png)
